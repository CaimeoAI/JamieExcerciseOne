    <h1>Tardigrade</h1>
    <p>
      Tardigrades (/ˈtɑːrdɪɡreɪd/), known colloquially as water bears or moss
      piglets,[1][2][3][4] are a phylum of eight-legged segmented
      micro-animals.[1][5] They were first described by the German zoologist
      Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773, who called them Kleiner Wasserbär
      ("little water bear").[6] In 1777, the Italian biologist Lazzaro
      Spallanzani named them Tardigrada /tɑːrˈdɪɡrədə/, which means "slow
      steppers".[7] They have been found everywhere in Earth's biosphere, from
      mountaintops to the deep sea and mud volcanoes,[8] and from tropical
      rainforests to the Antarctic.[9] Tardigrades are among the most resilient
      animals known,[10][11] with individual species able to survive extreme
      conditions — such as exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme pressures
      (both high and low), air deprivation, radiation, dehydration, and
      starvation — that would quickly kill most other known forms of life.[12]
      Tardigrades have survived exposure to outer space.[13][14] There are about
      1,300 known species[15] in the phylum Tardigrada, a part of the
      superphylum Ecdysozoa consisting of animals that grow by ecdysis such as
      arthropods and nematodes. The earliest known true members of the group are
      known from Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) amber, found in North
      America, but are essentially modern forms, and therefore likely have a
      significantly earlier origin, as they diverged from their closest
      relatives in the Cambrian, over 500 million years ago. Tardigrades are
      usually about 0.5 mm (0.020 in) long when fully grown.[1] They are short
      and plump, with four pairs of legs, each ending in claws (usually four to
      eight) or suction disks.[1][16] Tardigrades are prevalent in mosses and
      lichens and feed on plant cells, algae, and small invertebrates. When
      collected, they may be viewed under a low-power microscope, making them
      accessible to students and amateur scientists.[17]

    <h2>Naming</h2>
    <p>
      Johann August Ephraim Goeze originally named the tardigrade kleiner
      Wasserbär, meaning "little water-bear" in German (today, they are often
      referred to in German as Bärtierchen or "little bear-animal"). The name
      "water-bear" comes from the way they walk, reminiscent of a bear's gait.
      The name Tardigradum means "slow walker" and was given by Lazzaro
      Spallanzani in 1777.[18]

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest adults may reach a body length of 1.5 mm (0.059 in), the
      smallest below 0.1 mm. Newly hatched tardigrades may be smaller than 0.05
      mm.

    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>
      Tardigrades are often found on lichens and mosses, for example by soaking
      a piece of moss in water.[19] Other environments in which they are found
      include dunes and coasts generally, soil, leaf litter, and marine or
      freshwater sediments, where they may occur quite frequently (up to 25,000
      animals per litre). One tardigrade, Echiniscoides wyethi,[20] may be found
      on barnacles.[21]
